# To what extent are human rights abused/violated in China?

Chinese citizens have the right to vote.
They can vote in democratic village elections.
650,000 elections take place each year.
However
Elections are not truly democratic
CPC vets candidates -- non-CPC members are only permitted in government if they do as the CPC says
For example, Chen Zhu was the first non-CPC minister for 40 years
Therefore, human rights are violated in China because citizens do not have any real control over their government.

Chinese citizens have the right to free speech.
The 1982 constitution declares that all citizens have the right to free speech.
Newspapers can comment on social issues such as the environment, citizens can use social networks like Sina Weibo.
However
Chinese internet communications are censored
Government forces social networks to report and take down anti-government posts.
Sina Weibo introduced 'real names' policy.
Therefore, human rights are violated because Chinese citizens do not have true free speech.

Chinese citizens have the right to political protest.
As long as they get approval, any citizen can organise a protest.
For example, peaceful protests were permitted by the government using the Beijing Olympics in 2008
However
Government has to approve protest applicantions
Vast majority are not permitted to go ahead
In 2008, out of 77 applications, 74 withdrawn, 2 suspended, 1 denied.
Therefore, human rights are violated because while protest is allowed in theory, they are rarely permitted to go ahead in practice.
