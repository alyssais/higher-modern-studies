# Checks and Balances

The government of the United States is split up into three branches.

* The legislative branch is responsible for making laws.
* It is made up of the two parts of Congress: the House of Representatives and the Senate.
* Powers of Congress include
	* passing a bill (such as Obama's 2011 Budget Bill), 
	* impeaching a President (Clinton was almost impeached after lying under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky)
* **However**, the President can issue executive orders.
* This allows him to create laws without approval from Congress.
* For example, Bush established DHS in 2001.

* The executive branch carries out the laws. It is headed by the President.
* President is Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, can station troops abroad without approval from Congress
* President can veto legislation passed by Congress (Bush vetoed Stem Cells)
* **However**, only Congress has the power to declare war, and troops stationed abroad by the President cannot be kept their for more than 90 days without Congress approving.
* Congress can override a Presidential veto with a majority of two thirds. (Bush Medicare 2008)

* The judicial branch is the system of judges and courts.
* As well as telling if laws have been violated, can decide whether laws are unconstitutional.
* For example, Defence of Marriage Act 2013, giving states the right not to recognise same-sex marriages, was struck down by Supreme Court.
* **However**, Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President, and approved by Congress.
* Additionally, Congress has the power to change the size of the Supreme Court.
* For example, Obama appointed Sonya Sotamayer. Bush tried to appoint Harriet Miers but Congress rejected.

In conclusion, America has three balanced branches of government, with no one being in control above the others.
