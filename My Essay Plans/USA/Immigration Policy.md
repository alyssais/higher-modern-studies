# Immigration Policy

* Following 9/11 the public demanded tighter security
* The Immigration Act 1990 was letting too many in, and visas seemed to be being granted too easily.
* For example, the 9/11 suicide pilots had changed a visa from 'tourist' to 'student' without an adequate security check.
* **However**, since then, the USA PATRIOT Act 2001 and Border Security Act 2001 have passed.
* Presidents have become tougher on border security
* For example, Bush established the Department of Homeland Security, and in 2009 Obama appointed the USA's first 'border tsar', and in 2011 he made a speech in Texas promising tougher border security.

* Meanwhile, the business community still wants to encourage immigration.
* Many immigrants start up their own businesses, and the business community also likes immigration because it reduces labour costs.
* For example, Koreans own 1/2 of all small grocery stores in Los Angeles, and Cleveland has an 'immigrant investor program' that tries to create jobs and rejuvenate the city.
* **However**, the recession has created resentment toward immigrants.
* American taxpayers dislike paying for welfare, and immigrants are seen to be taking the jobs of white Americans.
* For example, in 2007 there were anti-immigration marches, and people have boycotted Mexican goods.

* Political parties are adopting more relaxed policies towards hispanics
* Hispanics make up 16% of the US population, and this number is growing, and Hispanics tend to be concentrated in 'swing states', such as California, Florida, Texas and New York.
* For example, in 2004, the Republican Party supported an amnesty programme for illegal immigrants, and won 40% of the Hispanic vote, while in 2008, when Republican views became stricter about immigration, Obama won 67% of the Hispanic vote.
* **However**, many Americans want a cut in immigration.
* Between 1 and 3 million immigrants arrive from Mexico every year.
* For example, in 2010, Arizona passed a law giving police the right to demand to see immigrants' papers, and some demand electrified border fences to keep immigrants out.

In conclusion, immigration has a very large effect upon the policies of the USA.
