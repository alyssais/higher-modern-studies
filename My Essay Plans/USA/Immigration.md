# Immigration

* Immigration boosts the American economy.
* Businesses depend on immigrants' cheap labour.
* Immigrants are willing to work for less than the minimum wage, with no holidays or sick pay, and are regarded by some to work harder than Americans. They also do jobs Americans don't want to do, working in agriculture, hospitality, tourism.
* **However**, since the recession many white Americans have become unemployed.
* This leads to anti-immigrant feeling since they have jobs but white Americans don't. Many argue that immigrants drive down wages.
* For example, the unemployment rate for white Americans rose from 4% in 2007 to 8% in 2010.

* Immigrants add to the cultural melting pot
* Bring aspects of their culture with them.
* For example, many black Americans now celebrate both Christmas and Kwanza, and Hispanic Americans celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
* **However**, many white Americans feel that immigrants are taking over American culture.
* There are fears that Spanish could overtake English as the main language of the US, and there are calls for a law declaring English the official language.
* For example, road signs in California are now in both English and Spanish, and it is predicted that in 2025, Spanish will overtake English as America's most prevalent language.


* Immigrants strain America's public services.
* Illegal immigrants don't pay taxes, but still use public services paid for by American citizens.
* For example, in California, $7.7b is spent caring for illegal immigrants' children, and between 1933-2003 60 hospitals have had to close due to unpaid fees, while others have reduced staff.
* **However**, immigrants bring in more to the US economy than they take out.
* Every year $30b is contributed by immigrants to the US economy, and immigrants who go through the US education system go on to jobs in Fortune 500 companies
* For example, Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram, a $35b company, was a Brazilian immigrant.

In conclusion, while there are costs associated with both groups, legal and illegal immigrants are vital to the US economy.
