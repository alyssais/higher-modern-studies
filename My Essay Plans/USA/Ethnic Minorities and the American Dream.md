# To what extent do ethnic minorities achieve the American Dream?

The American Dream is the idea that anybody in America can achieve their goals through hard work, achieving a successful career with financial security, a good home, and the ability to send children to a good school in a system of meritocracy.

* Underclass ethnic minorities can't get access to a good education.
* They have to attend under-resourced schools.
* For example, Crane High in Chicago's ghetto receives 20% of the resources a suburban school does. This leads to weak literacy and numeracy rates.
* **However**, middle class ethnic minorities can get access to good schools.
* Parents have the money to send their children to 'magnet' schools, which emphasise science and technology, and provide a gateway for children to Ivy League universities.
* For example, Asian children are often encouraged and supported to do well — Asians have the highest number of graduates per head.

* Underclass ethnic minorities can't get access to good housing.
* Lower-income ethnic minorities, or those on welfare, often meant in damp slum housing in ghettos, and even middle-class ethnic minorities are discouraged from buying property in white suburbs by estate agents.
* For example, Groveland in Chicago has been described as a "gilded ghetto" after many white residents moved away — "white flight" — when black residents moved in.
* **However**, the middle class ethnic minorities can afford to live in suburbs, and many Asians have high income levels.
* This allows them to lead a comfortable lifestyle, and integrate more easily into white communities.
* For example, there has been a rise in Hispanic-white marriages.

* Lower class ethnic minorities cannot access a living wage.
* Racism is still an issue — it is more difficult for ethnic minorities to get jobs, and they will often be paid less when they do. This means that ethnic minorities are unable to escape from poverty.
* Underclass ethnic minorities are forced to turn to illegal occupations such as drugs, prostitution, and robbery to survive.
* **However**, middle class ethnic minorities (especially Asians) can gain qualifications and achieve highly paid jobs in affluent areas such as silicon valley.
* Many ethnic minorities have embraced America's "enterprise culture" and have set up their own businesses.
* For example, 1/3 of Cubans earn over $60,000 p.a.

* Middle class ethnic minorities can afford private health insurance.
* Because of this, middle-class mortality and morbidity rates are much lower than underclass rates.
* Government legislation has attempted to close the gap. For example, Obamacare has provided all Americans with health insurance.
* **However**, underclass ethnic minorities cannot afford to access proper healthcare.
* They cannot afford medical insurance. This leads to illnesses going undetected until it is too late to cure them.
* For example, many underclass ethnic minorities are turned away from hospitals because they cannot afford to pay for treatment.

In conclusion, while some ethnic minorities can achieve the American Dream, the system overwhelmingly favours those born into wealthy families — it is certainly not a meritocracy.
