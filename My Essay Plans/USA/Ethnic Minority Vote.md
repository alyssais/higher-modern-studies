# Ethnic Minority Vote

* Ethnic minorities are more than 30% of the US population.
* They are often concentrated in "swing states", giving their votes disproportionate influence.
* For example, California, Texas, New York and Florida are all swing states with high concentrations of ethnic minority voters.
* **However**, the poorest ethnic minority people cannot or do not vote.
* Illegal immigrants cannot vote, and the illegal immigrant population is increasing. Additionally, poor Americans of all races often feel disengaged with the political system and choose not to vote.
* For example, there are over 14 million illegal immigrants in the USA.

* Party policies are increasing the influence of the ethnic minority vote in America.
* Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to vote for the Democratic Party because they tend to agree on welfare and immigration policies. Additionally, the Democratic Party in general tends to be more diverse than the Republican Party, attracting minority voters to the Democrats.
* For example, in 2012 93% of African Americans and 71% of Hispanics voted for Barack Obama (a Democrat) in 2012, while 60% of White Americans voted for Mitt Romney (Republican).
* **However**, while whites marginally favoured the Republican Party in the 2008 and 2012 Presidential elections, the white and Asian votes tend to be mixed.
* For example, in 2012 73% of Asians voted for Barack Obama, but in 2008 only 62% did.

* Candidate image is also an important factor influencing voting behaviour in the USA.
* Factors such as age, background and experience are also important.
* For example, many voters chose Obama because of his youthful image in comparison to his opponents.
* **However**, in the 2012 election, white Americans overwhelmingly voted for Mitt Romney.
* This is partly because of his wealthy, experienced image.
* For example, the 59% of white votes Romney attained in 2012 is one of the biggest percentages of White American votes ever.

In conclusion, many factors influence voting behaviour in the United States, but the ethnic minority vote is one of the most important of these factors.
